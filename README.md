## EXPERIMENT 3: PYTHON DATA ANALYSIS

## DESCRIPTION
This Jupyter Notebook is a data analysis project that works with a dataset of car models and their specifications. It contains two problems:

1. Problem 1 (loading the dataframe)
2. Problem 2 (using the dataframe)

## REQUIREMENTS
- Anaconda Navigator
- Jupyter Notebook
- .csv file

## PROBLEM 1: LOADING AND DISPLAYING THE DATA
In this problem, the task is to load the car from a .csv file and display specific portions of it.
This are the following steps:
1. Load the .csv file
2. Use head() and tail() functions to display the first five rows and the last five rows of the dataset

## PROBLEM 2: DATA SUBSETTING, SLICING, AND INDEXING
In this problem, we will use the dataframe from problem 1 to perform the subsetting, slicing, and indexing.
This are the following steps:
1. Display odd-numbered columns for the first five rows
2. Find and display the row containing 'Mazda RX4'
3. Find how many cylinders the 'Camaro Z28' has
4. Extract Cylinder and Gear information of the car models: 'Mazda RX4', 'Ford Pantera L', and 'Honda Civic'
